I’ve structured a web page to show-case projects that demonstrate my skill as a Web Developer. 

HTML elements have been applied to present information about me (my actual professional summary is pending as it is still being crafted), links to what I’ve produced so far (as well as room for what's next), some images, basic formatting and some contact information..

CSS is used to refine the formatting, add color, and adapt the rendering to accommodate different viewport sizes.

I approached the challenge with a solid plan that fell apart quickly. My advancement through the project has no comprehensible commit history.

This has been an amazing project! It has been invaluable for me to  contextualize the subject matter we’ve covered so far and has advanced my understanding of HTML and CSS properties and elements elevenfold!

That said, my comprehension of the tools I needed to complete the challenge was inadequate, and the work I am submitting is largely the result of trial and error. The code is bloated, there are unnecessary lines that I haven’t omitted, I’ve recognized more than a few instances where better practices should have been used, and this ought to be sharper and more efficiently structured.

Sadly, the deadline has arrived however, and I have to submit what I’ve got. I’m proud of my work regardless! I poured close to twenty hours into it and hardly a weary moment passed. It has been exciting and engaging work! I’m walking away from this challenge feeling great about pursuing a career path in Web Development.

P.s. Please forgive the casual README, time has been a factor.
